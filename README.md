(IBM Data Visualization with Python – Final Project)

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical automobile sales data to understand how economic recession periods impacted sales performance and related business indicators.

The project is divided into two main parts:

🔎 Part 1 – Data Analysis & Visualization

In this phase, the dataset was explored and analyzed using Python visualization libraries.
The focus was on:
	•	Sales trends during recession vs non-recession periods
	•	Impact of GDP and unemployment rate
	•	Advertising expenditure patterns
	•	Performance differences across vehicle types
	•	Seasonal effects on automobile sales

📊 Part 2 – Interactive Dashboard (Dash Application)

In the second phase, an interactive dashboard was developed using Plotly Dash.

The dashboard allows users to:
	•	Switch between Recession Period Statistics and Yearly Statistics
	•	Dynamically enable/disable year selection
	•	View multiple interactive charts based on selected criteria

Both parts are implemented in separate Python files, which can be reviewed independently.
